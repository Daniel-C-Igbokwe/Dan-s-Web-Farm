      <h1 class="heading">Terms and Conditions</h1>

      <p>
        1. <span>Introduction:</span> Welcome to DAN'S WEB FARM. By accessing or
        using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.
        Please read them carefully. <br />
        2. <span>Services:</span> DAN'S WEB FARM provides web development,
        design, and related digital services as agreed upon in the project
        proposal or contract. We strive to deliver high-quality services that
        meet your expectations. <br />
        3. <span>Project Acceptance:</span> We require a signed proposal or
        contract to begin any project. This document outlines the scope of work,
        timelines, and fees. Changes to the scope of work may incur additional
        charges.<br />
        4. <span>Client Responsibilities:</span>Clients are responsible for
        providing all necessary materials, content, and information required for
        the completion of the project. Timely feedback and approval are
        essential to meet project deadlines.<br />
        5. <span>Payment Terms:</span> Payment terms will be outlined in the
        project proposal or contract. Typically, a deposit is required before
        work begins, with the balance due upon project completion. Delayed
        payments may result in project delays.<br />
        6. <span>Intellectual Property:</span> All materials and content
        provided by the client remain the property of the client. DAN'S WEB FARM
        retains ownership of any intellectual property created during the
        project until full payment is received.<br />
        7. <span>Confidentiality:</span> Both parties agree to keep all
        project-related information confidential and not to disclose it to any
        third party without prior written consent.<br />
        8. <span>Warranties and Liability:</span> DAN'S WEB FARM will make every
        effort to ensure that the deliverables are free from defects. However,
        we do not warrant that the services will be error-free. Our liability is
        limited to the amount paid for the services.<br />
        9. <span>Termination:</span> Either party may terminate the project with
        written notice if the other party breaches the terms of the agreement.
        Termination does not absolve the client from paying for completed
        work.<br />
        10. <span>Governing Law:</span> These Terms and Conditions are governed
        by the laws of [Your Country/State]. Any disputes arising from this
        agreement will be resolved in the courts of Canada.<br />
        11. <span>Changes to Terms:</span> DAN'S WEB FARM reserves the right to
        modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. Clients will be notified
        of any changes in advance.
